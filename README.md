# Sports and Math Projects

Quantitative sports analytics projects combining probabilistic modeling, statistical inference, and data visualization. Includes win probability models, ranking systems, playoff simulations, and predictive analytics.

## Overview

This repository serves as the formal, technical home for my sports analytics work. While my [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/) feed contains over 89+ visualizations and quick experiments (often found by searching "Here's" on my profile, a term highly correlated with my new ideas), this repo filters the signal from the noise.

Here, I focus on **major, reproducible projects**. I am rebuilding my most significant informal analyses into fully documented codebases, notebooks, and write-ups. The goal is to provide technical readers with deep dives into the methodology, code, and data engineering behind the charts.

**Topics:** `python`, `data-science`, `sports-analytics`, `statistics`, `machine-learning`, `bayesian-statistics`

## Methodology

My approach combines rigorous statistical methods with modern machine learning techniques:
- **Bayesian Inference**: For robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: To model complex game scenarios and playoff outcomes.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating intuitive and interactive plots to communicate insights effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyMC, Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks
