## Overview

This repository contains formal documentation and code for selected sports analytics projects. Many originated as visualizations and threads posted to [X](https://x.com/search?q=from%3Asportsandmath1%20Here%27s&f=media) ([no login required](https://xcancel.com/search?q=from%3Asportsandmath1%20Here%27s)).

Projects here emphasize reproducibility, clear methodology, and technical depth.

## Methodology

My approach combines rigorous statistical methods with modern machine learning techniques:
- **Bayesian Inference**: For robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: To model complex game scenarios and playoff outcomes.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating intuitive and interactive plots to communicate insights effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyMC, Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks
